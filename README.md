# ESP32-helperfuncs
Simple functions that abstract functionality I use across all ESP32 projects

Nothing high brow.

Examples being that I have found the following things to be important for ALL new projects

PsychicHttp - to give me web support and Web Socket support (and good performance)
ElegantOTA - being able to update the ESP32 firmware OTA is a game changer
SSDP - never again will I need to check my DHCP server to locate the ESP32 IP; now it appears via uPNP in my Explorer + Network tab in Windows

NTP is useful  to set the times up on start.
